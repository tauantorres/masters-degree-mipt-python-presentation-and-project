    "\n",
    "### What are dataclasses — and why were they introduced (the historical / problem context)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Dataclasses were introduced in Python **3.7**, via `PEP 557`. ([Python documentation][1])\n",
    "* The design goal was to make it much easier to write classes that are “plain data holders” — i.e. classes whose main purpose is to store a set of fields/attributes, without a lot of custom logic. ([Python Enhancement Proposals (PEPs)][2])\n",
    "* Why was this needed? Because before dataclasses, if you wanted a class just to hold data, you had basically three suboptimal options:\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. Use a plain class and manually write `__init__`, `__repr__`, `__eq__`, etc. — which is tedious, boilerplate-heavy, and error-prone. ([realpython.com][3])\n",
    "  2. Use a tuple or list — but then you have no named fields, and it's easy to get order wrong or access by index incorrectly. ([realpython.com][3])\n",
    "  3. Use a dictionary — but then you lose structure, type hints, and are more prone to typos or missing keys. ([Medium][4])\n",

    "# `Quick Recap`: 🧩 What is a decorator (in Python)\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ Definition & basic idea:\n",
    "\n",
    "* In Python, a **decorator** is any *callable* (usually a function) that takes another function or class as input, and returns a modified version of it (or a new object). ([realpython.com][1])\n",
    "* The decorator syntax — using the `@` symbol — is syntactic sugar. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "  @my_decorator\n",
    "  def f(...) -> ...:\n",
    "      ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* Because of this, when we apply a decorator to a **class** (not just a function), the decorator receives the class object, can inspect or modify it (adding methods/attributes), and returns a modified class. This is how class decorators work. ([Python Enhancement Proposals (PEPs)][2])\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔧 What does a decorator let we do, and WHY and WHEN use it:\n",
    "\n",
    "Decorators provide a way to **separate concerns**: We can add or modify functionality (like logging, validation, automatic method generation, caching, access control, etc.) *without modifying the original function/class definition*. ([realpython.com][1])\n",
    "\n",
    "Some common uses of decorators:\n",
    "\n",
    "* For functions: logging, timing, caching/memoization, authorization, input validation, etc. ([GeeksforGeeks][3])\n",
    "* For classes: modifying or enhancing class behavior — for instance, automatically generating methods, injecting extra functionality, metaprogramming patterns. This is what `@dataclass` does. ([Python Enhancement Proposals (PEPs)][2])\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 Why `@dataclass` is implemented as a decorator (and what it does behind the scenes)\n",
    "\n",
    "* `@dataclass` is a **class decorator**. When you apply it to a class, it inspects the class definition: specifically, the **type annotations** of class variables to treat as “fields.” ([Python Enhancement Proposals (PEPs)][2])\n",
    "* Based on those fields, the decorator automatically generates several “dunder” (special) methods for the class: e.g., `__init__`, `__repr__`, `__eq__`, (optionally `__lt__`, ordering methods), maybe `__hash__`, depending on configuration. ([Python documentation][4])\n",
    "* The result: instead of writing all that boilerplate methods manually, you write only the **field definitions** (with types), decorate with `@dataclass`, and get a fully-functional “data container” class. This keeps code concise, maintainable and less error-prone. ([GeeksforGeeks][5])\n",

    "* Automatic `__eq__()` (and when configured, ordering methods) — means structural equality: two instances compare equal if all their fields are equal. ([Python Enhancement Proposals (PEPs)][2])\n",
    "* Support for default field values, including “default factories” (for mutable defaults). ([hamatti.org][5])\n",
    "* Ability to make classes immutable (i.e. “frozen dataclasses”) via `@dataclass(frozen=True)` — useful when you want hashable / unmodifiable value objects. ([hamatti.org][5])\n",
    "* Works seamlessly with Python’s static type hints (`PEP-526`): so we define fields with types, and dataclasses are fully compatible with type-checking tools. ([Python Enhancement Proposals (PEPs)][2])\n",

Also, we can Load each configuration parameter separately from the environment, providing default values or validation as needed, and once loaded, verify each parameter before using it in the application, and only then (iin some cases like MongoDB URIs) build the final connection string or object.\n"
