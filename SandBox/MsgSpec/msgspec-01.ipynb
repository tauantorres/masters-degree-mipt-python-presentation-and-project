    "## 🧠 What is msgspec — context, history, and why it exists\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔎 What is msgspec\n",
    "\n",
    "* msgspec is a Python library for **serialization / deserialization + schema-based validation**. It supports JSON, MessagePack, and other formats. ([PyPI][1])\n",
    "* It provides a `Struct` type: you define schemas using Python type annotations (similar to dataclasses), and msgspec uses those schemas to encode/decode objects. ([GitHub][2])\n",
    "* Under the hood, it is built for **high performance**: its JSON and MessagePack encoders/decoders are among the fastest available in Python. ([Jim Crist-Harif][3])\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 What problems msgspec tries to solve\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s recall what we saw with dataclasses and with a more heavy library like Pydantic:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Dataclasses: simple, but no builtin (de)serialization or validation.\n",
    "* Pydantic: full-featured (validation, parsing, serialization), but at a cost — performance overhead, memory overhead, heavier runtime cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "msgspec tries to be a *middle path / alternative*:\n",
    "\n",
    "* It aims to give **schema-based typed data structures + validation** (so we get some of the safety and structure of Pydantic), while also being **ultra-fast** in serialization/deserialization (JSON/MessagePack) — much faster than Pydantic in many cases. ([hrekov.com][4])\n",
    "* It’s lightweight (few dependencies) and optimized for performance-critical contexts: e.g. high-throughput message processing, APIs where serialization/deserialization is a bottleneck, data pipelines. ([PyPI][1])\n",
    "* The idea: if you need validated structured data **and** speed — or you care about runtime overhead — msgspec gives a compelling trade-off.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⚡ Performance advantage\n",
    "\n",
    "According to benchmarks:\n",
    "\n",
    "* msgspec often **encodes/decodes JSON ~2–5× faster** than Pydantic v2 for many workloads. ([hrekov.com][4])\n",
    "* In some benchmarks, msgspec is **~12× faster** than Pydantic v2 when using Struct schema definitions. ([Jim Crist-Harif][3])\n",
    "* It also tends to use less memory and fewer intermediate allocations because it decodes directly into typed objects, avoiding unnecessary dicts + second pass for validation. ([Jim Crist-Harif][3])\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of that, msgspec is often described as “the fastest serialization + validation library for Python” in contexts where its limitations (see below) are acceptable. ([Jim Crist-Harif][5])\n",
    "\n",

    "## 👨‍💻 Examples: Using msgspec for our sample models\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s take the same examples we used for dataclasses / Pydantic, and rewrite them using msgspec.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ Basic “User” example\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import msgspec\n",
    "\n",
    "class User(msgspec.Struct):\n",
    "    id: int\n",
    "    email: str\n",

    "# Deserialize / parse back to object\n",
    "u2 = msgspec.json.decode(data, type=User)\n",
    "print(\"Decoded:\", u2)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**What happens**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `msgspec.Struct` defines the schema (fields + types).\n",
    "* `.encode(...)` serializes the object to JSON bytes.\n",
    "* `.decode(..., type=User)` parses JSON bytes, validates types, and returns a typed `User` object.\n",
    "* If the JSON does not match the schema (e.g. wrong types), msgspec raises an error. ([Jim Crist-Harif][6])\n",

    "* When data is relatively “clean” or strictly typed (i.e. you don’t need many custom validation rules) — so msgspec’s “strict by default” schema decoding is acceptable. ([Jim Crist-Harif][6])\n",

    "\n",
    "* Compared to richer libraries — you lose **convenience features**: custom field validation hooks, default values behaviors, JSON-schema generation, ORM integration, rich error messages, optional coercion, etc. ([hrekov.com][7])\n",
    "* If you need **advanced validation logic**, complex constraints, or custom (de)serialization behavior — msgspec may be too “bare-bones.” You may have to write extra code manually. ([hrekov.com][7])\n",
    "* Ecosystem/tools/integrations are less mature than some heavy frameworks: you might miss built-in support for frameworks, plugins, or utilities. ([hrekov.com][7])\n",

    "* It supports multiple serialization formats, including JSON and MessagePack (and others) out of the box. ([PyPI][2])\n",
